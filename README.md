# Simon Game

## The Project

A web replication of the classic game of memory - Simon! Built with HTML, CSS, and Javascript using jQuery as part of the freeCodeCamp Front End Curriculum.

After turning the game on and starting, users are displayed a sequence of tones and lights, with the game requiring the player to repeate the series to progress to the next level. Levels increase the sequence by one step each round, and the tempo with which the game displays the sequence increases halfway throught the game.

Users have the ability to reduce or increase the level at which the game is completed (default is 20), and the ability to turn 'Strict Mode' on and off (an incorrect selection with strict mode on results in a game reset, with strict mode off, users only have to restart the level).

Planned feature additions - ability to select difficulty (i.e. increase or decrease the tempo of the sequence the game displays to the user each round), and a timer which resets the game if the user takes too long to make a selection.
